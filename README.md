- how can the heroku app be redeployed? -> it is automatically
- how is the auto deployment realized? -> Lars?aa
- how can I trigger the deployment of a change manually? -> pushing
- is a test run involved before deployment?
- how to fail-safe if remote urls are down and no usable local-cache ianswerdeanss available
