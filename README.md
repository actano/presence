# presence
List of teams indicating the presence and absence of its members

in case of problems, I'd wish to find the answers or links to the answers of these questions here:
- how can the app be started locally?
- how can the app be tested?
- how can the heroku app be redeployed?
- how is the auto deployment realized?
- how can I trigger the deployment of a change manually?
